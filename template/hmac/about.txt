Que: What we can do with hmac ?
Ans: We can verify the actual user those who are requested for API. We can store 2 values in users' machine. One is non-hash and another is hash.
     Everytime a user request to the API, send with these 2 values and in the server-end we can compare those 2 values to check
     whether those values are modified or not.
